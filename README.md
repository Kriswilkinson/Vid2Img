# Vid2Img

Vid2Img is a Python script that converts a video file into a series of still images, one for every second of the video. It's like the video version of a Slinky - it just keep on rollin' until there's nothing left!

## How to use

1. Install the required libraries:

    pip install opencv-python

2. Modify the script to specify the path to your video file:

    video_file = "D:/AI/Projects/Vid2Frames/input.mp4"

    
3. Run the script:

    python Vid2Img.py



This will create a folder called "images" containing one image for every second of the video. The images will be named "image_X.jpg", where X is the frame number.
